## Features

- Detects multiple types of road defects with bounding boxes and confidence scores  
- Fine-tuned YOLOv8 model on a custom annotated dataset  
- Supports image and video input for defect detection  
- Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved accuracy  
- Modular pipeline for annotation, training, evaluation, and inference

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- PyTorch (YOLOv8 implementation)  
- OpenCV  
- Roboflow / LabelImg for annotation  
- Google Colab for training
